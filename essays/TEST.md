UI Basics Essay 

# Experience 
  The practice of BrowserHistory 1, 2, and 3, were used to create a simple static web page. Each of the basic WoDs have their own specific purposes and objectives. I found all three rather challenging at first, but were simplified once I stepped back and re did them. BrowserHistory 1 and 2 covered the display and styling. At first I had a hard time beginning the BrowserHistory1. Then the use of the internet and text helped me figure out the two. Finally, BrowswerHistory3 was the most strenuous, mainly because it applied to styling and format. For example, in BrowserHistory3, the display was changed from rows to columns, figuring out how to realign and reformat became challenging. 

# Recommendation 
  As a recommendation, I would advise those that take on this assignment to reread the starting instructions before attempting the WoDs exercise. Having a well-thought understanding will help immensely. The WoDs should both test and advance one’s knowledge. In addition, the use of the internet and course texts are both very helpful in guiding one during the assignment. The WoD’s can be time consuming, however the famous quote greatly applies: “Only practice makes perfect.”

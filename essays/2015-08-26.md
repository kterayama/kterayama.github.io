Aloha All!

I'm very excited to be TA-ing for Dr. Port's class this semester and can't wait to get to know all of you and watch you grow into master coders. A little bit about my academic background, I took ITM 352 last semester to expose myself to coding and just for fun. The class was very challenging and rewarding at the same time. While I’m not an MIS major, I believe that learning these skills are important in today’s businesses. More specifically, I’m a Marketing major pursuing a career in Market Research and am continuously learning about Data Analytics.

My favorite thing to do to destress is going surfing with my dad. You’ll probably see us early Sunday mornings at Waikiki. I think it’s very important for students to have an outlet especially during the school year. We too often get sucked into our work and neglect our physical and mental health. I encourage all of you to find a hobby that gets you outside and away from technology for an hour to clear your mind. This will also help you when you get stuck coding; sometimes taking a break and coming back to your project with refreshed eyes is the best thing.
